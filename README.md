# Library-Management-System

I have created a Library Management System, which is designed to handle the basic functionality 
of a library. It will help the librarian and libraries smoothly deal with all the data related to the 
users and books, without having to use a pen and paper, which can sometimes be tedious and 
messy to manage. Hence, this project aims to reduce the labor intensive work and paperwork 
which traditional libraries had to deal with it. There are 5 tables included in the project – Admin, 
book, issuebook, requestbook and user. 
The ’book’ table consists of all the books present in the library and information related to the 
book. The ‘user’ table has all the information about the users(can be students or teachers).
The ‘issuebook’ table has information related to when a user has been issued a book from the 
library. When a user requests for a particular book, the information required is stored in the 
‘requestbook’ table
